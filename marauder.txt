The Marauder is an armoured, mine-protected vehicle that is produced by Paramount Group in South Africa. 
It was launched during the 2007 International Defence Exhibition (IDEX) and Conference in Abu Dhabi, the 
largest arms exhibition in the Middle East.

The Marauder was developed for reconnaissance and peacekeeping missions. It carries a crew of up to ten 
including the driver and commander.

Originally designed to operate in urban, built-up and confined areas it is smaller in both size and 
weight than the Matador, a similarly armoured vehicle. Vehicle configuration is either 4x4 or a 6x6. The 
Marauder has a cruising speed of around 100 to 120 km/h (62–75 mph), and a maximum range of 700 
kilometres (430 mi).

The Marauder’s double-skin monocoque hull provides protection against projectiles up to STANAG 4569 
Level III for the crew compartment.

The Marauder’s payload capacity allows for the fitting of various defence and weapons systems, including 
light and medium-calibre machine guns, cannon weapon installations, and missile launchers, as well as 
command, surveillance, and control systems. The vehicle can be configured such that mortars may be fired 
from the payload platform.
